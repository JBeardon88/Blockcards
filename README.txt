# Blockcards: A Card Engine

I ripped off mtg. It'll change as time goes on, but to start, it's just simplified magic. Play cards, summon creatures, cast spells, fuck around. You target for the AI rn because it's easier for me to debug that way. Fuck you.

## Features:
- **Energy system**: Gain and use energy to play cards.
- **Turn-based combat**: Includes main phases, combat phases, and end phases.
- **AI opponent**: Test your strategies against an AI.
- **Card effects**: Cards can have effects that trigger during various game phases.

## How to Play

Once the game starts, youâ€™ll be playing against an AI opponent. Here's what to expect:

- **Turn-based system**: Each turn is divided into phases: upkeep, main phase, combat, and end phase.
- **Commands**: You can use commands like `play`, `pass`, and more to interact with the game.
- **Energy system**: Spend energy to play cards. The game will handle energy regeneration automatically during each turn.
  
The goal is to defeat the AI opponent by reducing their life total to 0!
